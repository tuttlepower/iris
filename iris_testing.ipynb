Flores, George-Levi Gayle, Andr\\u00e9s Hincapi\\u00e9</title>\\n<description>We study the effects of job-protected leave policies on intergenerational mobility, long-run child outcomes, and parental decisions (labor market, investments in children, and fertility). We merge rich sources of historical information on family leave policies across the United States since 1973 with over 40 years of survey data covering two generations of individuals. Exploiting variation in the timing of job-protected leave policies introduced in a large set of 18 states and the District of Columbia before the enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in 1993, we find that the pre-FMLA protected leave policies had a level effect and a mobility effect. The level effect yields from overall improvements in education and wages for the children born under these policies. The mobility effect, chiefly an increase in intergenerational mobility in education, stems from heterogeneity in the effects of the policies: children of mothers with fewer years of education benefit more. As a potential mechanism, we find that the policies increased mothers\\u2019 time investments in children and the likelihood of the households having childcare expenses. Finally, consistent with the tradeoffs of policy design, we find that the policies exacerbated the motherhood penalty in labor market outcomes and that they affected fertility choices, increasing the likelihood of having a first child and decreasing the likelihood of having subsequent children.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31911#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31911#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Distributional Tax Analysis in Theory and Practice: Harberger Meets Diamond-Mirrlees -- by Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman</title>\\n<description>This paper proposes a new framework to study the distribution of taxes and the effects of tax reforms, connecting classical tax incidence analysis to optimal tax theory. To study the distribution of current taxes, labor taxes are assigned to the corresponding workers, capital taxes to the corresponding asset owners, and consumption taxes to consumers. The tax rates are the wedges between pre-tax prices (relevant for production) and after-tax prices (relevant for the work, saving, and consumption decisions of households). In contrast to the conventional approach that shifts taxes across production factors, our approach measures actual incomes, is internally consistent, and maximizes the comparability of tax progressivity and inequality over time and across countries. Applying this methodology to the United States, we find that the effective tax rate of the top 1% has declined from about 50% in the early 1950s to 32% in 2021. It is through the corporate tax that a high degree of tax progressivity was achieved in the middle of the 20th century. To analyze the distributional effects of tax reforms, mechanical changes in tax liability by income groups and aggregate revenue effects due to household behavioral responses are sufficient statistics in neoclassical optimal tax models. The effects of taxes on pre-tax prices at the heart of classical tax incidence analysis are irrelevant. This neoclassical framework can be extended to incorporate non-standard behavioral responses uncovered by the recent empirical literature. We apply this framework by providing a distributional analysis of frequently discussed tax reforms, including replacing employer-provided health insurance contributions by a payroll tax.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31912#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31912#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Polarizing Corporations: Does Talent Flow to \\\"Good\\\" Firms? -- by Emanuele Colonnelli, Timothy McQuade, Gabriel Ramos, Thomas Rauter, Olivia Xiong</title>\\n<description>We conduct a field experiment in partnership with the largest job platform in Brazil to study how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices of firms affect talent allocation.

Countries whose GDP growth per capita performance has been lackluster, like Japan, have done surprisingly well in terms of GDP growth per working-age adult. Indeed, from 1998 to 2019, Japan has grown slightly faster than the U.S. in terms of per working-age adult: an accumulated 31.9% vs. 29.5%. Furthermore, many advanced economies appear to be on parallel balanced growth trajectories in terms of working-age adults despite important differences in levels. Motivated by this observation, we calibrate a standard neoclassical growth model in which the growth of the working-age adult population varies in line with the data for each economy. Despite the underlying demographic differences, the calibrated model tracks output per working-age adult in most economies of our sample. Our results imply that the growth behavior of mature, aging economies is not puzzling from a theoretical perspective.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31914#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31914#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Federal Reserve Structure and the Production of Monetary Policy Ideas -- by Michael D. Bordo, Edward S. Prescott</title>\\n<description>We evaluate the decentralized structure of the Federal Reserve System as a mechanism for generating and processing new ideas on monetary policy over the 1960 - 2000 period. We document the introduction of monetarism, rational expectations, credibility, transparency, and other monetary policy ideas by Reserve Banks into the Federal Reserve System. We argue that the Reserve Banks were willing to support and develop new ideas due to internal reforms to the FOMC that Chairman William McChesney Martin implemented in the 1950s and the increased ties with academia that developed in this period. Furthermore, the Reserve Banks were able to succeed at this because of their private-public governance structure. We illustrate this with a time-consistency model in which a decentralized organization is better at producing new ideas than a centralized one. We argue that this role of the Reserve Banks is an important benefit of the Federal Reserve\\u2019s decentralized structure by allowing for more competition in formulating ideas and by reducing groupthink.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31915#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31915#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>The Outlook for Women's Employment and Labor Force Participation -- by Stefania Albanesi</title>\\n<description>Employment and participation rates for US prime age women rose steadily during the second half of the 20th century. In the last 30 years, however, those rates stagnated, even as employment and participation rates for women in other industrialized countries continued to rise. I discuss the role of changes in the earnings structure and persistent institutional barriers, such as limited investment in family policies, that may be holding back employment among American women today. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced employment more for women than for men and raised the barriers to female participation due to the increase in childcare responsibilities during this period. Yet, the diffusion of remote and hybrid work arrangements in its aftermath may be beneficial for women's participation in the long run, even if  both men's and women's post-pandemic employment growth so far are strongly associated with access to remote work options.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31916#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31916#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Age and Suicide Impulsivity: Evidence from Handgun Purchase Delay Laws -- by John J. Donohue, Samuel V. Cai, Arjun Ravi</title>\\n<description>We provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of variation in suicide impulsivity by age by examining the impact of firearm purchase delay laws by age. Prior studies of firearm purchase delay laws use traditional two-way-fixed-effects estimation, but we demonstrate that bias due to heterogenous treatment effects may have inflated previous estimates relative to our stacked-regression approach. We also develop a triple-difference stacked-regression estimator to confirm the robustness of our results. We find that purchase delay laws reduce firearm suicide for the overall adult population, but this effect is largely driven by a 6.1 percent reduction in firearm suicides for young adults ages 21-34. We demonstrate that the relationship between purchase delay laws and firearm suicide reduction weakens with age and is not driven by gun ownership rates. We argue that this is due to the impulsiveness of young adults in committing suicide, indicating that removing firearm access for young adults may provide a critical deterrent to suicide.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31917#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31917#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Family Trees and Falling Apples: Historical Intergenerational Mobility Estimates for Women and Men -- by Kasey Buckles, Joseph Price, Zachary Ward, Haley E.B. Wilbert</title>\\n<description>Efforts to document long-term trends in socioeconomic mobility in the United States have been hindered by the lack of large, representative datasets that include information linking parents to their adult children. This problem has been especially acute for women, who are more difficult to link because their surnames often change between childhood and adulthood. In this paper, we use a new dataset, the Census Tree, that overcomes these issues by building on information from an online genealogy platform. Users of the platform have private information that allows them to create links among the 1850 to 1940 decennial censuses; the Census Tree combines these links with others obtained using machine learning and traditional linking methods to produce a dataset with hundreds of millions of census-to-census links, nearly half of which are for women. With these data, we produce estimates of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status from fathers to their sons and daughters. We find that for married men and women, the patterns of mobility over this period are remarkably similar. Single women, however, are less mobile than their male counterparts. We also present new estimates that show that assortative mating was much stronger than previously estimated for the US.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31918#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31918#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Browsers Don\\u2019t Lie? Gender Differences in the Effects of the Indian COVID-19 Lockdown on Digital Activity and Time Use -- by Amalia R. Miller, Kamalini Ramdas, Alp Sungu</title>\\n<description>We measure the impact of the initial Indian national COVID-19 lockdown on digital activity using browser histories of 1,094 individuals, spanning over 31.5 million website visits on computers and mobile devices. Reflecting the predicted increase in the value of online activity, both men and women in our sample dramatically increased their internet browsing during the lockdown. However, men\\u2019s browsing increased by significantly more, causing gender gaps overall and in key browsing categories, and in browsing on mobile devices. Our browser data showed significant relative reductions in women\\u2019s online job search, corroborated in aggregate data obtained from a major Indian online job platform, indicating potentially persistent harms to women\\u2019s employment. Consistent with increased childcare obligations driving the observed gender gaps, we find that gaps were greatest among parents. Men and women in our sample had similar browsing levels and trends pre-pandemic, which diverged during the lockdown. Our primary findings therefore shed new light on determinants of digital time use, while also highlighting the importance of considering both extensive and intensive margins of digital activity to track the digital divide. In our secondary analysis of time devoted to childcare, we find conflicting survey responses between fathers (who report an increase relative to mothers) and mothers (who report no such increase). While our data cannot directly resolve this conflict, they do show fathers having larger increases in time spent online, with no relative increase in childcare-related browsing. This secondary result demonstrates the value of complementing survey data with digital trace data.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31919#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31919#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>How Much Are the Poor Losing From Tax Competition? -- by Mathilde Mu\\u00f1oz</title>\\n<description>This paper quantifies the unequal welfare effects of tax competition. I derive the optimal tax and transfer schedules in a free mobility union composed of countries that can either compete or set a uniform federal tax rate. In the absence of fiscal coordination, governments internalize that any decentralized tax reform can lead to the out-migration of taxpayers at the top of the income distribution while increasing the in-migration of transfer recipients. As a result, the optimal level of redistribution is always lower in the tax competition equilibrium. Numerical calibrations show that being in a competition union rather than in a federal union decreases poorer individuals\\u2019 welfare by up to -20 percent. In contrast, the rich experience higher welfare in the tax competition equilibrium due to lower tax rates.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31920#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31920#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Regulating Artificial Intelligence -- by Joao Guerreiro, Sergio Rebelo, Pedro Teles</title>\\n<description>We consider an environment in which there is substantial uncertainty about the potential negative external effects of AI algorithms. We find that subjecting algorithm implementation to regulatory approval or mandating testing is insufficient to implement the social optimum. When testing costs are low, a combination of mandatory testing for external effects and making developers liable for the negative external effects of their algorithms comes close to implementing the social optimum even when developers have limited liability.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31921#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31921#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Winners and Losers from the U.S.-China Trade War -- by Alicia H. Dang, Kala Krishna, Yingyan Zhao</title>\\n<description>We investigate the phenomenon of trade re-allocations across countries as a result of the U.S.- China trade war. Using quarterly data on U.S. imports, we find evidence, as do others, of trade diversion in a range of industries and products, including products not targeted by U.S. tariffs on China. We are however the first to ask what seems to drive these trade reallocation activities. First, we show that they seem to be driven by differences in comparative advantage across countries: countries with a greater revealed comparative advantage in a product benefit (in terms of exports to the U.S.) more from U.S. tariffs on China. Second, we show that there is evidence of spillovers to similar non-targeted products: products in similar industries (as defined by their HS codes) are also similarly affected. This is consistent with the colocation effects. Third, our findings also suggest that bystander countries with greater capital abundance are more heavily impacted in capital-intensive industries, suggesting that a higher proportion of more flexible or transferable assets provides flexibility to alter production to respond to new trade opportunities. Finally, we show that the countries that export more to the U.S. as a result of the tariffs on China also export more to other countries. This suggests that firms are entering these countries and once there, export not just to the U.S. but everywhere.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31922#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31922#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Macroeconomic Announcement Premium -- by Hengjie Ai, Ravi Bansal, Hongye Guo</title>\\n<description>The paper reviews the evidence on the macroeconomic announcement premium and its implications on equilibrium asset pricing models. Empirically, a large fraction of the equity market risk premium is realized on a small number of trading days with significant macroeconomic announcements. We review the literature that demonstrates that the existence of the macroeconomic announcement premium implies that investors' preferences must satisfy generalized risk sensitivity. We show how this conclusion generalizes to environments with heterogeneous investors and demonstrate how incorporating generalized risk sensitivity affects economic analysis in dynamic setups with uncertainty.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31923#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31923#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>Can Socially-Minded Governance Control the AGI Beast? -- by Joshua S. Gans</title>\\n<description>This paper robustly concludes that it cannot. A model is constructed under idealised conditions that presume the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially-minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI even if this does not maximise profits. It is demonstrated that a socially-minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimise harm from AGI that might be created by unrestricted products released by for-profit firms. The reason is that a socially-minded entity has neither the incentive nor ability to minimise the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms and cannot preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31924#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31924#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n<item>\\n<title>The Impact of AI and Cross-Border Data Regulation on International Trade in Digital Services: A Large Language Model -- by Ruiqi Sun, Daniel Trefler</title>\\n<description>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and of cross-border restrictions on data flows has created a host of new questions and related policy dilemmas. This paper addresses two questions: How is digital service trade shaped by (1) AI algorithms and (2) by the interplay between AI algorithms and cross-border restrictions on data flows? Answers lie in the palm of your hand: From London to Lagos, mobile app users trigger international transactions when they open AI-powered foreign apps. We have 2015-2020 usage data for the most popular 35,575 mobile apps and, to quantify the AI deployed in each of these apps, we use a large language model (LLM) to link each app to each of the app developer's AI patents. (This linkage of specific products to specific patents is a methodological innovation.) Armed with data on app usage by country, with AI deployed in each app, and with an instrument for AI (a Heckscher-Ohlin cost-shifter), we answer our two questions. (1) On average, AI causally raises an app's number of foreign users by 2.67 log points or by more than 10-fold.  (2) The impact of AI on foreign users is halved if the foreign users are in a country with strong restrictions on cross-border data flows.  These countries are usually autocracies. We also provide a new way of measuring AI knowledge spillovers across firms and find large spillovers. Finally, our work suggests numerous ways in which LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used in other applications.</description>\\n<link>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31925#fromrss</link>\\n<guid>https://www.nber.org/papers/w31925#fromrss</guid>\\n</item>\\n</channel>\\n</rss>\\n\"\n"

Yet, the diffusion of remote and hybrid work arrangements in its aftermath may be beneficial for women's participation in the long run, even if  both men's and women's post-pandemic employment growth so far are strongly associated with access to remote work options.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"We provide the first quasi-experimental estimates of variation in suicide impulsivity by age by examining the impact of firearm purchase delay laws by age. Prior studies of firearm purchase delay laws use traditional two-way-fixed-effects estimation, but we demonstrate that bias due to heterogenous treatment effects may have inflated previous estimates relative to our stacked-regression approach. We also develop a triple-difference stacked-regression estimator to confirm the robustness of our results. We find that purchase delay laws reduce firearm suicide for the overall adult population, but this effect is largely driven by a 6.1 percent reduction in firearm suicides for young adults ages 21-34. We demonstrate that the relationship between purchase delay laws and firearm suicide reduction weakens with age and is not driven by gun ownership rates. We argue that this is due to the impulsiveness of young adults in committing suicide, indicating that removing firearm access for young adults may provide a critical deterrent to suicide.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Efforts to document long-term trends in socioeconomic mobility in the United States have been hindered by the lack of large, representative datasets that include information linking parents to their adult children. This problem has been especially acute for women, who are more difficult to link because their surnames often change between childhood and adulthood. In this paper, we use a new dataset, the Census Tree, that overcomes these issues by building on information from an online genealogy platform. Users of the platform have private information that allows them to create links among the 1850 to 1940 decennial censuses; the Census Tree combines these links with others obtained using machine learning and traditional linking methods to produce a dataset with hundreds of millions of census-to-census links, nearly half of which are for women. With these data, we produce estimates of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status from fathers to their sons and daughters. We find that for married men and women, the patterns of mobility over this period are remarkably similar. Single women, however, are less mobile than their male counterparts. We also present new estimates that show that assortative mating was much stronger than previously estimated for the US.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"We measure the impact of the initial Indian national COVID-19 lockdown on digital activity using browser histories of 1,094 individuals, spanning over 31.5 million website visits on computers and mobile devices. Reflecting the predicted increase in the value of online activity, both men and women in our sample dramatically increased their internet browsing during the lockdown. However, men\\u2019s browsing increased by significantly more, causing gender gaps overall and in key browsing categories, and in browsing on mobile devices. Our browser data showed significant relative reductions in women\\u2019s online job search, corroborated in aggregate data obtained from a major Indian online job platform, indicating potentially persistent harms to women\\u2019s employment. Consistent with increased childcare obligations driving the observed gender gaps, we find that gaps were greatest among parents. Men and women in our sample had similar browsing levels and trends pre-pandemic, which diverged during the lockdown. Our primary findings therefore shed new light on determinants of digital time use, while also highlighting the importance of considering both extensive and intensive margins of digital activity to track the digital divide. In our secondary analysis of time devoted to childcare, we find conflicting survey responses between fathers (who report an increase relative to mothers) and mothers (who report no such increase). While our data cannot directly resolve this conflict, they do show fathers having larger increases in time spent online, with no relative increase in childcare-related browsing. This secondary result demonstrates the value of complementing survey data with digital trace data.\",\n",

I derive the optimal tax and transfer schedules in a free mobility union composed of countries that can either compete or set a uniform federal tax rate. In the absence of fiscal coordination, governments internalize that any decentralized tax reform can lead to the out-migration of taxpayers at the top of the income distribution while increasing the in-migration of transfer recipients. As a result, the optimal level of redistribution is always lower in the tax competition equilibrium. Numerical calibrations show that being in a competition union rather than in a federal union decreases poorer individuals\\u2019 welfare by up to -20 percent. In contrast, the rich experience higher welfare in the tax competition equilibrium due to lower tax rates.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"We investigate the phenomenon of trade re-allocations across countries as a result of the U.S.- China trade war. Using quarterly data on U.S. imports, we find evidence, as do others, of trade diversion in a range of industries and products, including products not targeted by U.S. tariffs on China. We are however the first to ask what seems to drive these trade reallocation activities. First, we show that they seem to be driven by differences in comparative advantage across countries: countries with a greater revealed comparative advantage in a product benefit (in terms of exports to the U.S.) more from U.S. tariffs on China. Second, we show that there is evidence of spillovers to similar non-targeted products: products in similar industries (as defined by their HS codes) are also similarly affected. This is consistent with the colocation effects. Third, our findings also suggest that bystander countries with greater capital abundance are more heavily impacted in capital-intensive industries, suggesting that a higher proportion of more flexible or transferable assets provides flexibility to alter production to respond to new trade opportunities. Finally, we show that the countries that export more to the U.S. as a result of the tariffs on China also export more to other countries. This suggests that firms are entering these countries and once there, export not just to the U.S. but everywhere.\",\n",

A model is constructed under idealised conditions that presume the risks associated with artificial general intelligence (AGI) are real, that safe AGI products are possible, and that there exist socially-minded funders who are interested in funding safe AGI even if this does not maximise profits. It is demonstrated that a socially-minded entity formed by such funders would not be able to minimise harm from AGI that might be created by unrestricted products released by for-profit firms. The reason is that a socially-minded entity has neither the incentive nor ability to minimise the use of unrestricted AGI products in ex post competition with for-profit firms and cannot preempt the AGI developed by for-profit firms ex ante.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and of cross-border restrictions on data flows has created a host of new questions and related policy dilemmas. This paper addresses two questions: How is digital service trade shaped by (1) AI algorithms and (2) by the interplay between AI algorithms and cross-border restrictions on data flows? Answers lie in the palm of your hand: From London to Lagos, mobile app users trigger international transactions when they open AI-powered foreign apps. We have 2015-2020 usage data for the most popular 35,575 mobile apps and, to quantify the AI deployed in each of these apps, we use a large language model (LLM) to link each app to each of the app developer's AI patents. (This linkage of specific products to specific patents is a methodological innovation.) Armed with data on app usage by country, with AI deployed in each app, and with an instrument for AI (a Heckscher-Ohlin cost-shifter), we answer our two questions. (1) On average, AI causally raises an app's number of foreign users by 2.67 log points or by more than 10-fold.  (2) The impact of AI on foreign users is halved if the foreign users are in a country with strong restrictions on cross-border data flows.  These countries are usually autocracies. We also provide a new way of measuring AI knowledge spillovers across firms and find large spillovers. Finally, our work suggests numerous ways in which LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used in other applications.\",\n",
